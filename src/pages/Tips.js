                    <h4>Catch this silent thief of sight before you lose vision.</h4>
        If you are at risk for glaucoma, you should see your ophthalmologist regularly for eye exams. They can find the disease in its early stages,
         then watch and treat it. It’s equally important to take your glaucoma medications exactly as your doctor says to.

                   <h4>Taking steroid medication? Talk with your eye doctor.</h4>      
        Taking steroids for long periods of time or in high doses can raise your eye pressure, especially if you have glaucoma. Steroids that you take 
        by mouth or use around your eyes are the most likely to raise eye pressure. Always tell your eye doctor if you are taking any kind of steroids.

                        <h4>Eat well to see well.</h4>
                        Eat plenty of leafy green vegetables and colored fruits, berries and vegetables every day. They contain vitamins and minerals that protect your 
        body and eyes. In fact, studies show that eye-healthy foods are better than vitamins at preventing glaucoma.

                        <h4>Exercise regularly but carefully.</h4>
                        Intense exercise that raises your heart rate can also raise your eye pressure. But brisk walking and regular exercise at a moderate pace can lower 
        eye pressure and improve your overall health. If you lift heavy weights, have a qualified trainer show you how to breathe properly during this exercise.

                        <h4>Avoid head-down positions.</h4>
                        If you have glaucoma or you're at high risk of the disease, don’t place your head below your heart for long periods of time. 
        That includes staying away from inversion tables or gravity boots for back pain. Head-down positions can greatly raise your eye pressure. 
        Some people with severe glaucoma may need to avoid certain yoga positions. Ask your doctor if you need to avoid a head-down position in your exercise routine.

                        If you have glaucoma, avoid sleeping with your eye against the pillow or on your arm. People who have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at risk of glaucoma, 
        or may have more serious disease. If you snore heavily or stop breathing throughout the night, get tested for OSA.

                        If your blood pressure drops too low during sleep, it can worsen glaucoma damage. If you take blood pressure medicine at night,
         or if you have low blood pressure symptoms (like feeling woozy), tell your ophthalmologist. They can discuss this with your primary care doctor. Do not change your blood pressure medication on your own.
         Eye injuries can lead to glaucoma. Always wear protective eyewear during sports or while working on your home and in your yard.

                        Yes, it starts as simple as that; you are what you eat and so is your eyesight. Foods rich in nutrients like vitamin C and E, zinc, lutein and omega-3 fatty acids strengthen your eyes against age-related eye problems like cataracts and macular degeneration. Some great foods for eye health include:

Vegetables: Leafy green veggies like spinach, collards and kale

Fish: Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel

Fruits: Citrus fruits like lemons, grapefruits and oranges

Nonmeat protein sources: Eggs, nuts and beans

        So, here is to those of you who like their eyesight more than a cigarette.

                        If you considered sunglasses a mere fashion accessory, think again. A right pair of shades can help you stay away from cataracts, macular degeneration 
        and pinguecula by blocking out sun’s harmful UV (ultraviolet) rays. A good pair of UV protection sunglasses can block 99 – 100% of harmful UV rays. In case you are wondering, UV protection contact lenses are also available.

                        In addition to causing neck, back and shoulder pain, staring too long at a computer/phone screen can affect your eye health severely. Some of the eye problems you can get from excessive exposure to computer/phone screens include:

Eyestrain
Dry eyes
Blurry vision
Long distance focus issues
Some protective measures include:

Updating your glasses or contacts prescription for screen exposure
Seeking proper medical care in case of prolonged eyestrain and considering computer glasses for computer use
Choosing a comfortable supportive chair and positioning it where your feet lie flat on the floor
Blinking more if your eyes dry up
Following 20-20-20 rule where you rest your eyes every 20 minutes by looking 20 feet away for 20 seconds continuously
Taking 15-minutes breaks every 2 hours and getting up from your chair is also recommended

                        Don’t only blame computers and phone screens for eyestrain. Books and written documents can also cause eyestrain when looked upon for extended periods.
 So, make sure to get your head up, look away from the docs and just blink your eyes for a few seconds to relieve the strain.

                        <h4>7: Consult Eye Doctor Regularly.</h4>
        Never undermine the significance of a regular eye exam. Your eyes need specialized care because they are one of the most sophisticated organs in your body. 
        Spotting eye diseases like glaucoma is quite challenging. Only an eye specialist will be able to do so appropriately using  the required knowledge, experience, tools and techniques. Experts recommend having a comprehensive eye exam at least once every two years. Some of the essential components of a comprehensive eye exam might include:

Vision tests to determine farsightedness/nearsightedness, presbyopia (changes in vision due to aging process), astigmatism (blurred vision caused by a curved cornea)
Tests to determine coordination between both eyes
Optic nerve and eye pressure tests to spot glaucoma
Microscopic and external eye examination before and after dilation.

                        <h4>Stick to Quality Products If Eye Makeup is Your Thing.</h4>
                        The truth is that rubbing disease-laden hands over your eyes is not the only way to harm them, eye makeup can serve the purpose as well, 
        especially if you are not quality conscious. Harmful bacteria can thrive in a lot of unlikely places, including the mascara you wear and the tips of liner pencils you use to beautify your eyes with.
         Don’t stick with the same mascara tube for more than 3 months and don’t forget to sharpen the tips of your favorite liner pencils. Always prefer quality brands when buying eye makeup to sustain and enjoy healthy eyes as long as possible.

                        <h4> Stay Hydrated.</h4>
                        Talking of dry eyes, dehydration can also lead to it. Human body relies heavily on water to function smoothly. If you are not conscious about fluid level in your body, tear production in your eyes is also affected amongst a myriad of other complications, which results in dry eyes. 
        Simply, stay hydrated to keep your eyes out of trouble.
